| Topic       | Web application that fetches and displays data from poe.ninja api, poe.watch api and poe-antiquary api. Backend can call a Python script that returns a prediction on a given item for the whole league (90 days). Neural network was trained on data from 3.0 to 3.15, including the first 16 days of 3.16.																																						|
